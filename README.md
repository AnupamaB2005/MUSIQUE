# MUSIQUE
I developed Musique, a Spotify-inspired web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to stream music, create playlists, and upload tracks. With features like media controls and a search function, Musique caters to both listeners and creators, showcasing my web development skills and focus on user-centric design.
